  <h1>Interaction Flow</h1>
      <p> John comes home from a long weekend at work and wants to watch one of the documentaries that
    he has been sucked into the last week. He opens his account and finds that his wife has been
    watching some drama series and is getting suggested more and his recently played is full of
    all the currently watching shows she has been starting and never finishing. He decides to create
    her own profile, so she can keep it separate from his, and he can easily resume his documentaries. </p>
